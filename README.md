# Offensive players and team performance in the 2017/18 NFL season

The NFL Season consists of a 16-game regular season, followed by the playoffs.
There are 32 teams in the league which consist of 46 active players, 11 of which (at most) can be on the field at one time. 
The same players do not play both offence and defence as in most team sports. When one team is on offence it uses its offensive team and when it is on defence it uses its defensive team. Also there are special teams which appear much less than the previous two and their performance (generally) does not have a major impact on the outcome of games. 
Each player on a team has a fixed position and there are only specific actions which a given position is allowed to take.
This analysis will be focused on the performance of players in offensive teams. 

The data in this analysis:

- The top 50 players in the passing, rushing and receiving categories 
- The regular season standings

Outline:

Part 1: Assuming that most of a team's offensive success is influenced by pass offence, is there a significant correlation between a team's overall success and the performance of its quarterback ? 

Part 2: What are the correlations between a team's total amount of wins in a season and the basic overall stats of the team ? 

Part 3: In each table players are ranked based on the stat that is most significant to their position. But each table has more than one stat. If a player is ranked high based on one stat, is he likely to have good results in other stats ?
