Analysis of data on the 2015/16 Zika virus outbreak

[open-source data set from buzzfeed news](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/zika-data#united-states)

The repository contains an already made csv file, which i will not use. 
I will use only the raw, unorganized data.

Included will be:

- The countries that were caught in the outbreak
- The consequences of the outbreak
- The months spanning the duration of the outbreak
- Consequences of the outbreak for individual months 

I will try to specifically find out:

- Where it originated 
- When it started to spread at an alarming rate 
- What was the damage that it caused 
- When it started to subside
