Programming 1 project:

Analysis of data from the 2017 NFL regular season, top 50 players of each category

[stats 2017](http://www.nfl.com/stats/player?seasonId=2017&seasonType=REG&Submit=Go)

Included will be:

- The averages of player stats 
- The rankings of the players by stat category

I will try to specifically find out:

- Do the best teams each have top-rated players ? 
- Does offence or defence affect the rankings more ? 
- What positions contribute the most to a team's success ? 
- Are there factors that contribute to a team's success that are not captured in the stats ? 

The csv files included in this repository are the tables of each player stat category.
Also, there is the script that I used to get the data from the website.
